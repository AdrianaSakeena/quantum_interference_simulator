# Quantum Interference Simulator (Baseline)

This project builds a classical basis for a quantum interference simulator.
It models particle detection on a finite-resolution screen using a Gaussian
source distribution.

## Experiment 1: Classical Measurement
- Particles are sampled from a Gaussian distribution
- Detector has finite spatial resolution
- Probability density is reconstructed via a histogram

This baseline is used to validate detector modeling before introducing
quantum superposition and interference.
